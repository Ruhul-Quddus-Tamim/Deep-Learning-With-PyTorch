**Transfer Learning**

In the first model, I'll use pre-trained models to classify between the negative and positive samples; dataset object is created. The particular pre-trained model will be ResNet-18;

1. Change the output layer.

2. Train the model.

3. Identify several misclassified samples.

For the second model, I'll build another classifier using another pre-trained model, namely the VGG-16 model, following the same steps as I've completed in the previous module using the ResNet50 pre-trained model. Then testing the classifiers on a test set and compare the performance between these two models.
